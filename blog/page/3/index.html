  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I won this dumb online contest and I got a Diablo 3 beta key. I don&#8217;t usually win stuff but then again I don&#8217;t usually enter that many competitions either. Didn&#8217;t have to come up with something funny to say or anything, just insert name and email&#8230;then a few days later I got this email with &#8220;Congratulations you&#8217;re a winner, here&#8217;s a beta key.&#8221;. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, before I got into the beta I watched a crapton of playthrough videos on youtube and I kinda got into the Monk a lot though I also liked watching the Barbarian doing his stuff. For some reason I tend to favor melee characters on this kind of games. The exception is probably, oddly enough, Diablo 2..where I mostly played a Summoner Necromancer. You know, the guy who goes to the moor to grab a bazillion skeletons and then proceeds to faceroll whatever he wants to while watching a movie on the tv.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, looks like everything went mighty fine with the host migration. Still have some maintenance to work on but nothing major. I can now add new content! Not like I will, but&#8230;yeah&#8230;you know.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently been dabbling with a few mmo&#8217;s and I got into the Diablo 3 beta. Really hyped about that so at least <em>that&#8217;s</em> something to talk about, right?</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the website is almost 2 years old.</p>

<p>PS: This host seems to be a hell of a lot faster than the last, easier to use management tools too. Godaddy can bite my shiny metal ass.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, Skyrim is out. So many great games coming out that I think this winter will be spent with a blanket and me playing them. Battlefield 3 is a blast, takes a hell of a long time to unlock multiplayer stuff when compared to Bad Company 2 but I think it&#8217;s better this way. Modern Warfare 3 will have to wait since I don&#8217;t have the time nor wallet to get it right now.</p>

<p>I was having trouble and still do with Skyrim but I guess future patches will fix the odd bugs that always show up after initial launch. The first bug that I came upon was right after launch. I got the intro cinematics but as soon as a menu started to show up I was presented with my desktop and Skyrim would have simply crashed with no error message whatsoever. Making use of my Google Fu I found a fix, odd as it can be.</p>

<blockquote><p>Open Start Menu &#8211; Open Control Panel &#8211; Double click on Sound.</p>

<p>On the playback tab, right click on speakers or whatever has the green tick on your computer then click Properties.</p>

<p>Go to the Advanced tab and select 24 bit, 44100Hz (Studio Quality) in the menu.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m still presented with random crashes every now and then, good thing I&#8217;m a savegame freak. I&#8217;m not quite sure what causes it but I suspect the nvidia drivers, I once caught one of the famous &#8220;driver XXX has crashed and successfully recovered&#8221; or whatever. No idea what causes this. Could be overheating but sensors say the videocard sits in the ~60ºC range, which is pretty darn acceptable if you ask me so I guess I&#8217;ll just keep on saving like a madman and hope for an eventual fix. It kinda screws game immersion for me :(</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Had another annoying thing happen. There&#8217;s this part where we have to kill and loot an npc, what was happening was no loot was possible. I had the arrow on top of the dead npc pointing at his corpse but while hovering over him no &#8220;Press E to Search&#8221; was showing up. He was a tough bugger to kill, fortunately I could kill him with 3 arrow sneak attacks (focused on stealth and ranged). I saved and loaded a bunch of times, tried killing him melee&#8230;and nothing. Then I thought about loading a previous savegame. I noticed an &#8220;(Auto)&#8221; savegame from when I entered his chamber first and loaded that. Killed him and looted without a problem. Though annoying because he dropped a quest item this got me to thinking just how many other loot tables have I missed due to this? Feh. Still, hell of a game. Don&#8217;t miss it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I finally ordered some cubes from Cube4you. I have to say that the shipping prices are a real pita but somewhat understandable since it comes all the way from Shanghai, China. Cube4you was awesomely fast sending the stuff, I made the order on a saturday and it was ready for UPS pick up the very next day even it being a sunday. Let&#8217;s hope they didn&#8217;t get any of the orders wrong now :p</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of what I ordered, one of each.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dayan Guhong 3x3x3 DIYKit &#8211; Black</li>
<li>Cube4you 3x3x3 DYI Speed Cube &#8211; Black</li>
<li>New Type-A 3x3x3 DIYKit &#8211; White</li>
<li>Type F-II 3x3x3 Cube (NIB) &#8211; White</li>
<li>Diangsheng 3x3x3 &#8211; White</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">
  I like Swype, I really do. It&#8217;s probably the best keyboard out there for Android, definitely so if you have a 3.2&#8243; or smaller screen. Their betas are usually freely available, which means you get to use the latest test version for free and give them feedback on  their forums and possibly anonymous usage statistics, can&#8217;t quite remember. The big issue with Swype is you get to choose 3 language packages. English/Spanish, English/Chinese and English/All Other Languages. Since I&#8217;m a native portuguese speaker, I want to have the portuguese language on my phone. This ends up forcing me to use the &#8220;All Others&#8221; package and downloading/installing a huge file roughly around 10-12mb. Since I have 150mb internal memory, 12mb takes a big chunk out of it mostly with dictionaries and keyboards I will never use. Most keyboards have their various language modules available in the market, so if I want to use the portuguese language I just download the PT package and that&#8217;s it. With Swype that&#8217;s not so simple. I had to tweak the .apk a bit to remove all the crap I will never use and then install it again.

  This show is really good, I&#8217;m surprised. I checked some Dr. Who a while ago and didn&#8217;t find it much to my taste but decided to give Torchwood a go, maybe I should check Dr. Who again.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things that started to bug me lately was how images were all over the place on the site&#8217;s RSS feed. This ruined formatting and really made the whole thing quite messy if any of you out there read what I post here through RSS.</p>

<p>As it turns out the fix is as simple as installing a plugin that solves that. It&#8217;s called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/align-rss-images/" target="_blank">Align RSS Images</a></span> and you can install it just like any other plugin. Easy peasy.</p>
