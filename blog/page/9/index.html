  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve always had this strange fascination for Rubik&#8217;s Cubes. In some way or another I&#8217;ve always had a few cubes decorating my place even if only just because they have all those pretty little colors to cheer up the place.</p>

<p>Recently I started taking them a bit more seriously and trying to solve them, I even bought a decent 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 on a toy store.</p>

<p>After playing with them for a while I remembered this world called the internet exists and started googling for them. Found these awesome videos explaining how to solve them using a few simple algorithms and after a few days playing with them I&#8217;ve somehow memorized them already and can solve the 3x3x3 in under 10 minutes. Still a lot to go till I match those guys I saw on youtube solving it in under 30 seconds but still&#8230;.it&#8217;s pretty darn good. Also, solved the 5x5x5 for the first time yesterday. Felt kind of proud about it.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a couple of videos showing how to solve the 3x3x3 in a few easy steps/algorithms.</p>

</p>


<p>There are also videos showing how to solve the other various cubes but mostly they&#8217;re all about reducing the larger cube into a 3x3x3 so it can be solved the same way. That&#8217;s how I solved the 5x5x5.</p>

<p>Good times!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/macports.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-405" title="macports" src="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/macports-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>One of the reasons I really like Mac OS X is it&#8217;s native Unix origin. In fact, Mac OS X <em>is </em>Unix. This translates into having easy access to common Unix tools and applications. I won&#8217;t say many users take advantage of this, I&#8217;m even willing to bet most don&#8217;t, but those who do feel life is a lot easier I&#8217;m sure. Tools as simple as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">wget</a> or <a href="http://lftp.yar.ru/" target="_blank">lftp</a> make mine a lot easier.</p>

<p>Most of these tools can be installed in any regular Unix/Linux flavor but they have to be ported into the flavor before they can be used. This means some lines of code have to be changed in order for our Unix flavor to understand it.</p>

<p>Meet Macports.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Macports</strong></p>

<p>Macports makes it easy to download and install Unix applications, be it simple command line tools or full fledged graphical applications. The easiest way to get it is download the .dmg for your version of Mac OS <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php" target="_blank">here</a> and install it on your applications folder. You will also need XCode installed in your Mac. XCode is a set of developer tools for Mac allowing you to compile and install applications from source. You can find it in your Mac OS X install CD under the &#8220;Optional Installs&#8221; folder. From this moment on you will have access to the &#8216;port&#8217; command on your Terminal app.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Applications</strong></p>

<p>Installing ported applications is very easy. All you have to do is issue the following command inside a Terminal app.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo port -v install wget</p></blockquote>

<p>What this will do is download the ported version of wget and all it&#8217;s necessary dependencies, compile them and install them on your system. The -v switch tells it to run on verbose mode, displaying all he&#8217;s doing at the moment. You can turn it off if you don&#8217;t need or like it. A list of all the software you can install this way can be found <a href="http://www.macports.org/ports.php" target="_blank">here</a>. Since it needs superuser access it will ask for your password.</p>

<p>Uninstalling applications is also simple.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo port -v uninstall wget</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the options I found really useful is the ability to create a .dmg that installs everything you need to install the chosen package in any given system. Running the following command for example will create a .dmg file with wget and all it&#8217;s dependencies ready to install in any mac even without Macports installed.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo port -v dmg wget</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Keeping up to date</strong></p>

<p>It is also very easy to keep all your installed applications up to date with the latest software&#8217;s version. Issue the following commands on your Terminal app.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo port -v sync</p>

<p>sudo port -v selfupdate</p>

<p>sudo port -v upgrade outdated</p></blockquote>

<p>What the first command will do is syncronize with the Macport&#8217;s server and figure out what&#8217;s the newest version number for all available software. The second command will update Macports itself it need be. The third and final command will upgrade all your outdated software to it&#8217;s current versions.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping it clean</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m one of those guys that likes to keep it&#8217;s system clean of near useless stuff, disc space is something I&#8217;ll never have enough of. This said, Macports likes to keep old versions of software installed after you update them to the newest version as well as intermediate files that are needed to compile and install software. This adds up bit by bit till it takes up large chunks of precious disc space. Running the following commands will get rid of all that for you.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo port clean &#8211;all installed</p>

<p>sudo port uninstall inactive</p></blockquote>

<p>The first command will clean all intermediate files needed to compile and install a port and the second will uninstall inactive ports such as old versions.</p>

<p><strong>Uninstalling Macports altogether</strong></p>

<p>If for some reason you don&#8217;t want Macports or any of it&#8217;s applications on your system, issuing the following commands on your Terminall app will do so for you.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo port -f uninstall installed</p></blockquote>

<p>This will uninstall all your Macports installed software, but you will still be left with files such as configuration files and databases it uses. To get rid of them issue this command.</p>

<blockquote><p>sudo rm -rf \<br/>
/opt/local \<br/>
/Applications/DarwinPorts \<br/>
/Applications/MacPorts \<br/>
/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.<em> \<br/>
/Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts</em>.pkg \<br/>
/Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg \<br/>
/Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup \<br/>
/Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 \<br/>
/Library/Tcl/macports1.0 \<br/>
~/.macports</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using Gmail since 2004. What this means is I have 6 years worth of e-mail stored in it, never deleting anything including videos, powerpoint presentations, sound clips, etc.. And what this means is I had 4.5GB of data stored. I have at the moment 7437MB I can use to store stuff on Gmail, so 4.5 gigs doesn&#8217;t look like a problem..but it is, and here&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been trying a couple of alternatives to OS X&#8217;s Mail.app, tried <a href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/" target="_blank">Postbox</a> and really liked it so I might consider getting it in the  future. Like with any mail client you install one must first configure it to access your e-mail account and nowadays the most flexible way to do it is through IMAP, which Gmail supports.</p>

<p>Now, imagine the client you&#8217;re currently testing having to download 4.5GB worth of e-mails or even just the headers. Not good, huh? I know there must be an option somewhere to disable this but that&#8217;s not the point, I like having all my e-mails stored locally so I can access them whenever I want and like a friend said someday we might end up not having a good relationship with Google and it wouldn&#8217;t do being them having all our e-mail from the past 6 years stored. The point is I want all that e-mail stored locally and even possibly backed up somewhere physical near me.</p>

<p>Then it hit me. I had like a gazillion and one e-mails of worthless powerpoints with flowers and inspirational catch phrases, videos of people doing dumb stuff, sound clips some friends send me some times of their music, etc. Just how much disc space was all this worth? 3.4GB apparently. Since I deleted all that useless junk in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>How can you delete it all in just a few minutes you ask? Pretty simple. Just add the following code to your Gmail search bar and have the files with those extensions neatly displayed for your delete hammer pleasure.</p>

<blockquote><p>has:attachment (*.wmv || *.mov || *.mpg || *.mpeg || *.mp3 || *.ppt || *.pps)</p></blockquote>

<p>Feel free to add whatever extensions you want, I have most likely forgot a couple of them that are extremely delete hammer worthy but even so I ended up 1.1GB of downloadable e-mails that aren&#8217;t packed with useless stuff, not as much as it was in any case. In time I will remember a few more items I don&#8217;t really want to have stored in Gmail and delete them as well. After this is done, just head on to your trash folder and empty it and voila! Look at all the stuff you <em>don&#8217;t</em> have to download next time you change mail client or reinstall it. Awesome, right?</p>

<p>I do recommend, of course, that you at least take a quick peek at the e-mails&#8217; you&#8217;re deleting subjects just in case you end up deleting something you don&#8217;t want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes we all wish we could access our home computer with our phone wherever we are just to check on something or do some menial task. If you have a Symbian phone and your computer runs Mac OS X, that&#8217;s possible! You can do it with any Unix box, in fact. You won&#8217;t have a visual interface and it will only be useful to those of you who are used to Unix console commands, but if you are indeed used to them you already know you can do pretty much everything you feel like on your machine with them.</p>

<p>This guide will not cover what SSH is nor teach you unix console commands. What this guide will teach you is how to get a SSH client in your Symbian phone and get it to work with Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Mac OS X, like any unix box, lets you access your machine remotely through SSH. In Mac OS X it even comes pre-installed, all you have to do is activate it. To do this, open your System Preferences pane and click on Sharing. On the Sharing screen, add a checkmark on the Remote Login service like on the following picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/prefs.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-309" title="prefs" src="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/prefs-300x251.png" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></a></p>

<p>It is advisable to change the default port SSH uses to something not easily guessed. I won&#8217;t get into details about that. You can test your connection by opening a Terminal window and typing &#8220;ssh 127.0.0.1&#8243; or whatever IP you currently have. If a login window preceded by a question if you are willing to accept the crypto key shows up, your SSH server is up and running.</p>

<p>Next up, you&#8217;ll need to install PuTTy in your Symbian phone. You can get it <a href="http://s2putty.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here</a>. Launch it and start a new profile. Insert the name you want to use for this profile, the target computer&#8217;s IP and login name. This is your <em>short</em> username, not your long one on OS X.</p>

<p><a href="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SuperScreenshot0011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-312" title="SuperScreenshot0011" src="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SuperScreenshot0011-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Move back into the main program&#8217;s window and select the target host you just created. You will be prompted for a password.</p>

<p><a href="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SuperScreenshot0013-300x225.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-313" title="SuperScreenshot0013" src="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SuperScreenshot0013-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Once you fill in the password field, you will be logged into you Mac OS X box and can start exploring the wonderful world of  the unix console.</p>

<p><a href="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SuperScreenshot0014-300x225.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-320" title="SuperScreenshot0014" src="http://ncatarino.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SuperScreenshot0014-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>As an example you can type &#8220;python -m SimpleHTTPServer&#8221; to start a http server with your current directory tree at <a href="http://$HOSTNAME:8000/.">http://$HOSTNAME:8000/.</a> Pretty useful to quickly retrieve files through http to another computer or even your phone.</p>

<p>Hope you find this info useful. Feel free to add a comment with any question you might have.</p>

  No próximo fim de semana de 27/28 Março de 2010 vai ser inaugurado o Estúdio Mahtab Danças Étnicas.
</p>




<p style="text-align: left;">
  Mesmo a calhar, assim dá para brincar com a nova objectiva para a máquina. Se o sítio não tiver muita luz espero é que não se importem com o flash, não me tou bem a ver levar o tripé. Provavelmente a maioria das oportunidades de disparo serão de coisas em movimento, acaba por ser meio irrelevante ter ou não tripé.
</p>




<p style="text-align: left;">
  É porreiro ver malta amiga e conhecida conseguir pouco a pouco o que quer :) Fico contente que este pessoal tenha conseguido o espaço e leve adiante a ideia de tornar a dança ainda mais parte da sua vida.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Really enjoying WordPress this far. Next up is to install Gallery2 and grab the WPG2 plugin for WP so I can both have an online gallery to dump all the pics I take and link/embed them in WP.</p>

<p>Got the theme&#8217;s css and bits of code working the way I want to. Didn&#8217;t find the heart in me to design a website banner from scratch so I removed the banner space code entirely from the page. Maybe later on I&#8217;ll work on it, in the mean time if you want to give it a go and see if you can come up with something to jam in there give me a call.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s starting to look decent(ish).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi.</p>

<p>This BLAG was born out of a need I&#8217;ve had for a while to have a place where I can dump useful or funny bits of information flowing around me. In other words, a place to drop random stuff.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not intended to be taken seriously taking into account my dark humored and sometimes politically incorrect nature. If you ever see anything here you don&#8217;t like, please feel free to close your browser and never come back.</p>

<p>Some posts are in English, some in Portuguese. Sometimes I feel like typing in either one of those languages and that&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>That being said, hope you enjoy your stay and have fun.</p>
