  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had the most awesome weekend of all time over at Leiria. Sometimes I wish I lived there, maybe someday I will. Took a few pictures, maybe eventually sometime around this week I&#8217;ll find the patience I need to fiddle around with the new gallery software. I brought the old gallery down since I didn&#8217;t get it to work with a couple of things I wanted and the new one isn&#8217;t &#8220;consumer ready&#8221; yet. Thing with having the greatest of times is you eventually get thrown back at &#8220;real life&#8221; and you end up in a state of mind that makes you think you should borrow someone else&#8217;s antidepressant pillz. But hey, there&#8217;s always next year. Right? :)</p>

<p>Spielberg. The aftermath of an alien invasion. Dude what was in ER. Works for me.</p>

<p>A friend told me about this after I whined about how great Game of Thrones was and now I had nothing to watch. Turns out it&#8217;s not bad, not bad at all. I&#8217;d like to see more alien tech instead of all the drama going on but I guess they don&#8217;t want to shoot all their shells before they know what kind of ground they&#8217;re stepping on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s something about old 60&#8242;s/70&#8242;s movies that makes me love them. I can&#8217;t really say why, they just do. I&#8217;ve been running this sort of old movie marathon and all I can think of is how most of the time I enjoy them a hell of  a lot more than recent ones.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a kid spending entire weekend afternoons watching movies on TV and for some reason those days seemed to last longer and packed with great stuff on the tube. I can&#8217;t really put this into words so I won&#8217;t keep trying.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember much about my childhood, people usually say this is because I had a happy childhood and I think that&#8217;s true. But sitting on my living room&#8217;s couch watching movies is a vivid clear memory I have. My parents even bought me a VHS VCR eventually and that was a big deal at the time. Those things were expensive! From then on I became a regular at the local movie rental place. I don&#8217;t remember how the ladies at the counter looked like but I do remember they were always nice to me and usually greeted me with a smile every time they saw me.</p>

It&#8217;s a hell of a fine game, up till you reach max level. Though this is open for discussion, I found myself with nothing to do. Met some great people there and I&#8217;m keeping in touch with them for other gaming experiences but I&#8217;m done with Rift.
</p>


<p>That left a hole in my gaming schedule that I tried to fill with some stuff on Steam but I kept getting somewhat bored with everything there, then I thought of Eve Online.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know when sometimes you start watching a movie thinking it&#8217;s going to be rather cheesy and you&#8217;re generally just in it for the fun of watching things explode and monsters cut into pieces and <em>then</em> the movie is actually one of the best you&#8217;ve seen lately? Yeah.. That happened to me twice in the past week.</p>

<p>I began watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0822847/" target="_blank">Priest</a> with a pre-defined notion it was &#8220;vampire ass kicking movie&#8221; with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079273/" target="_blank">Paul Bettany</a> and I pretty much like everything he&#8217;s in. Turns out there&#8217;s <em>so</em> much more to the movie than that. The plot sounds like the cheesiest thing ever but they actually pull it off quite nicely. I was reminded of two movies while watching it, Blade Runner and Equilibrium. The cityscape is one of the most beautiful I&#8217;ve seen in a while and the action isn&#8217;t bad either. Granted it&#8217;s an action movie, lots of it going on, but this movie has lots of eye candy as well. I really recommend it.</p>

<p>The other one was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464580/" target="_blank">Stake Land</a>. Nothing in imbd&#8217;s page prepared me for the great movie this turned out to be. It&#8217;s no masterpiece, but it&#8217;s one of the best horror flicks I&#8217;ve seen in a <em>long</em> while. The acting is great, the scenery is awesome, the story is compelling with some twists in it that made me go &#8220;Whoa.&#8221; and I really felt sad when some of the stuff on there happened (no spoilers!). To put it simply, if you&#8217;re a horror fan you <em><strong>have</strong> </em>to see it. You know that feeling you got when you saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/" target="_blank">28 Days Later</a> and thought to yourself that was a damn good movie? Watch this one then :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No idea what was the exact day I bought the domain/hosting and started working on this site as a hobby, but it&#8217;s been roughly a year now. I know this because I had to renew it all, sometimes I wonder if it&#8217;s worth it since I end up spending quite some time without paying any attention to it. I guess that&#8217;s the nature of such sites :)</p>

<p>Been spending a *lot* of time playing Rift, I&#8217;m quite amazed how good something I&#8217;ve never heard of till about a couple of months ago can be. Couple of guys I know mentioned the open beta was up and I tried it. A few hours after I found myself buying it. I had recently restarted playing WoW but as soon as the month&#8217;s subscription ended I was finding myself really bored with it and Rift was entering it&#8217;s head start for pre-order customers. Perfect timing. Dragon Age 2 is supposed to be coming out too, that&#8217;s another one to check out.</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t spent much time around my Spica as of lately, which is just as well since development for the Cyanogenmod Spica beta seems to have come to a halt. Probably because everything&#8217;s working quite well and it really shouldn&#8217;t be called a beta anymore. Been using the 8.3 beta for a few months now and it&#8217;s working like a charm.</p>

<p>Also, saw Tron Legacy the other day. Awesome sauce.</p>
