    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I won this dumb online contest and I got a Diablo 3 beta key. I don&#8217;t usually win stuff but then again I don&#8217;t usually enter that many competitions either. Didn&#8217;t have to come up with something funny to say or anything, just insert name and email&#8230;then a few days later I got this email with &#8220;Congratulations you&#8217;re a winner, here&#8217;s a beta key.&#8221;. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, before I got into the beta I watched a crapton of playthrough videos on youtube and I kinda got into the Monk a lot though I also liked watching the Barbarian doing his stuff. For some reason I tend to favor melee characters on this kind of games. The exception is probably, oddly enough, Diablo 2..where I mostly played a Summoner Necromancer. You know, the guy who goes to the moor to grab a bazillion skeletons and then proceeds to faceroll whatever he wants to while watching a movie on the tv.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After a few hours with each, got the Barbarian to 13 (max level at beta) and the Monk to 11. I have to say I enjoyed the Barbarian a <em>lot</em> more than the monk. And I also have to say I think the reason is because the gap closer charge thingie on the Barbarian is a <em>fury generator</em> and on the monk it&#8217;s a <em>spirit spender</em>. I know it may seem like not a big deal, but it just makes playing the Barbarian a lot more fun. I also seem to always be out of spirit with the Monk while with the Barbarian I found fury management to not be an issue. The Barbarian also feels like this massive dude who stomps his foot and breaks all tables in a 100 meter radius, that&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<p>So, yeah. Guess who will be playing a Barbarian May 15th. I already have the client preload file from battle.net, all there is to it now is waiting the <em>almost</em> two months till I can install it.</p>

<p>Played a bit with the Demon Hunter too but it felt a bit too much faceroll for me, I just pressed shift and shot at random till everything was dead. It&#8217;s a bit more fun to leap around and bash stuff with the Barbarian. I also noticed that as soon as something got near me and managed to land a hit my hp bar would take a dive <em>pretty darn fast</em>. Later in the game in Hell or Inferno I think they&#8217;ll have a lot of issues if there&#8217;s a boss in any way like Duriel in Diablo 3. That guy was a nightmare.</p>

<p>I plan to get all classes to 13 to get a feel for how they all play and spend some time looking at abilities and whatnot but I really think the main character I&#8217;ll be playing from release day onward is the big dude with a club that likes to bash things.</p>

<p>PS: Whoa, this new host is <em>faaaast.</em> I&#8217;m loving it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, Skyrim is out. So many great games coming out that I think this winter will be spent with a blanket and me playing them. Battlefield 3 is a blast, takes a hell of a long time to unlock multiplayer stuff when compared to Bad Company 2 but I think it&#8217;s better this way. Modern Warfare 3 will have to wait since I don&#8217;t have the time nor wallet to get it right now.</p>

<p>I was having trouble and still do with Skyrim but I guess future patches will fix the odd bugs that always show up after initial launch. The first bug that I came upon was right after launch. I got the intro cinematics but as soon as a menu started to show up I was presented with my desktop and Skyrim would have simply crashed with no error message whatsoever. Making use of my Google Fu I found a fix, odd as it can be.</p>

<blockquote><p>Open Start Menu &#8211; Open Control Panel &#8211; Double click on Sound.</p>

<p>On the playback tab, right click on speakers or whatever has the green tick on your computer then click Properties.</p>

<p>Go to the Advanced tab and select 24 bit, 44100Hz (Studio Quality) in the menu.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m still presented with random crashes every now and then, good thing I&#8217;m a savegame freak. I&#8217;m not quite sure what causes it but I suspect the nvidia drivers, I once caught one of the famous &#8220;driver XXX has crashed and successfully recovered&#8221; or whatever. No idea what causes this. Could be overheating but sensors say the videocard sits in the ~60ÂºC range, which is pretty darn acceptable if you ask me so I guess I&#8217;ll just keep on saving like a madman and hope for an eventual fix. It kinda screws game immersion for me :(</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Had another annoying thing happen. There&#8217;s this part where we have to kill and loot an npc, what was happening was no loot was possible. I had the arrow on top of the dead npc pointing at his corpse but while hovering over him no &#8220;Press E to Search&#8221; was showing up. He was a tough bugger to kill, fortunately I could kill him with 3 arrow sneak attacks (focused on stealth and ranged). I saved and loaded a bunch of times, tried killing him melee&#8230;and nothing. Then I thought about loading a previous savegame. I noticed an &#8220;(Auto)&#8221; savegame from when I entered his chamber first and loaded that. Killed him and looted without a problem. Though annoying because he dropped a quest item this got me to thinking just how many other loot tables have I missed due to this? Feh. Still, hell of a game. Don&#8217;t miss it.</p>
